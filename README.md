### Core Admissions Architectural Documents

This repository contains the overall architectural diagrams and Architectural Decision Records (adr) concerning the overall design of the Core Admissions System. 

Architectural Diagrams are generated from Plant-UML using a custom set of macros. 

Architectural Decision Records are used to document the decisions made while working out the architecture for this system. ADR's for each sub-component should live in the repository for that component.
