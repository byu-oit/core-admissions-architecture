# Architectural Decision Records

Architectural Decision Records (ADR) are a record of decisions made while designing and implementing a system. There are a few simple rules:

- ADR entries are numbered in sequential order. 
- All ADR entries follow the same naming pattern. 
- All ADR entries follow the same template for the diagram. 
- ADR's are never removed from the repository. If there is a change in a decision a new ADR is created that superceeds the old one. 


See https://adr.github.io/madr/ for more information and https://github.com/adr/adr-tools/tree/patch-1 for a set of command line tools that make creating ADR records easier. 

ADR records always reside in the `doc/architecture/adr` folder within a repository.
